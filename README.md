# Book-Keywords-Analysis

Structure:

- The notebook **results.ipynb** contains all analyses and visualizations.
- The scripts **scraper_guardian.py**, **tfidf.py**, **search_enginge.py** and **download_webpage.py** contain function implementations that I use throughout the notebook.
- The **"data/"** directory contains all intermediate data from my analysis.
- The **process_book.ipynb** contains my project progress log.
- The text file **requirements.txt** contains necessary libraries for running all notebooks and scripts

Make sure to download all of these, and do not change the locations of any of the scripts or datafiles.
Before running the notebook, please install all required libraries in your virtual environment. To do so, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' from your virtual environment.
